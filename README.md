Investigating a Dataset 




    An analysis will be performed based on a dataset that collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. The dataset looks at those that attended their appointments, and those that missed their appointments. Data has been provided through Kaggle.

    This analysis will look at three questions to determine factors about appointment attendance:

        Which of the following has the largest sum of no-shows? Scholarship, hipertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap?
        Which neighborhood has the most no-shows? What kind of issues do these patients have?
        Which day of the week is best for appointments and which day of the week is the worst?
        Does age and patients with hipertension, diabetes, scholarship, and alcoholism affect no-show appointments?
